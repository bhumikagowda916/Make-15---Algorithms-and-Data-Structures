# Make 15 – Algorithms and Data Structures

A Java-based card game implementation developed as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures module.  
This project applies object-oriented programming principles and structured data management to simulate a card-based “Make 15” game.

---

## Project Overview

Make 15 is a console-based Java application that models a card game where players aim to create combinations that total 15.

The system demonstrates:

- Object-oriented design
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Data structure usage
- Class interaction and modular architecture
- Basic file handling for high score tracking

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- File Handling (highscores.txt)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

---

## Core Concepts Applied

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Modular design
- Logical condition handling
- Algorithmic validation of card combinations
- Separation of game logic from data models
- Unit-style testing through test classes

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/bhumikagowda916/Make-15---Algorithms-and-Data-Structures.git

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

3. Ensure `highscores.txt` is located in the correct directory.

4. Navigate to the `src` folder.

5. Run:

   MakeFifteen.java

The game will launch in the console.
